# 📄 Resume / Text Classification System

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Resume Classification System that automatically categorizes resumes into predefined domains such as:

* Data Science
* Web Development
* Finance
* Software Engineering

It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning techniques to analyze resume text and predict the most relevant job category.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Input resume text is collected
2. TF-IDF converts text into numerical vectors
3. Logistic Regression model classifies the text
4. Output → predicted category
