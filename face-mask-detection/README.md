# 😷 Face Mask Detection System (Self-Contained)

A real-time **Face Mask Detection System** built using **Deep Learning, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras**.
**Fully self-contained**: Generates synthetic training data and uses built-in OpenCV face detection.

Detects whether a person is wearing a mask using webcam.

## ⚙️ Quick Start (Self-Contained)

```bash
cd face-mask-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py  # Generates data + trains model (few minutes)
python detect.py # Webcam detection (press 'q' to quit)
```

## 📸 Output

* 🟢 **Green Box** → Mask detected  
* 🔴 **Red Box** → No Mask detected

**Note**: Trained on synthetic cartoon faces, works on real faces too!

## 📊 Synthetic Dataset

Generates 2000 images:
- Face oval + eyes + mouth
- Blue rectangle mask added/removed

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* 🌐 Deploy as Web App (Flask / FastAPI)
* 📱 Mobile App integration
* 🤖 Alert system (Email/SMS when no mask detected)
* 🐳 Docker deployment
* 🧠 Improve accuracy with larger dataset
